## About the project

Jibebe Web App is a Next.js web application designed to assist farmers in autonomously ploughing their farms. The web app allows users to define the boundaries of their farm by setting coordinates, and generates tracks for the tractor to follow in order to plough the farm efficiently.


## Overview

Farming is a labor-intensive task that requires farmers to spend significant time and effort in ploughing their fields. To streamline this process and make it more efficient, the Autonomous Farm Ploughing Web App offers a user-friendly interface for farmers to define the boundaries of their farm by setting coordinates. These coordinates are then used to generate tracks for the tractor to follow, optimizing the ploughing path and reducing manual effort.

## Features

Jibebe Web App includes the following features:

#### Boundary Setting

Users can easily set the boundaries of their farm by clicking points on a map interface. The web app allows users to define complex shapes for their farms, including irregular boundaries.

#### Track Generation

Once the boundaries are set, the web app uses advanced algorithms to generate optimal tracks for the tractor to follow while ploughing. These tracks are designed to minimize overlap and reduce the time and effort required for ploughing.

## Technology Stack

The Autonomous Farm Ploughing Web App is built using the following technology stack:

-Next.js: A popular React framework for building server-rendered React applications.
-LeafletJS: A powerful mapping platform for visualizing maps and generating tracks based on coordinates.
-Geospatial Libraries: Libraries such as Turf.jsto handle geospatial data and perform calculations related to farm boundaries and track generation.

## Future Enhancements

Jibebe Web App has potential for future enhancements, including:

-Integration with GPS-enabled tractors or farm equipment for real-time tracking and ploughing.
-Adding weather and soil data to optimize ploughing paths based on environmental conditions.
-Incorporating machine learning algorithms to further optimize track generation and ploughing paths.
-Enhancing the user interface with additional features, such as farm management, reporting, and analytics.


## Conclusion

The Autonomous Farm Ploughing Web App is a cutting-edge solution that empowers farmers to autonomously plough their farms with efficiency and precision. With its user-friendly interface, advanced track generation algorithms, and export capabilities, the web app streamlines the ploughing process, saving time and effort for farmers. The future enhancements hold great potential for further optimizing farm ploughing and improving overall farm management.
